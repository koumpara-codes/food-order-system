# Food Order System (Python)

A simple, interactive command-line application that allows users to browse a menu, select items, and calculate a total bill. This project was developed as part of my Python learning journey with Mimo.

## Features
- **Interactive Menu:** Displays food items and their prices.
- **Custom Orders:** Allows users to select multiple items.
- **Dynamic Calculation:** Automatically calculates the subtotal and final bill.
- **Input Validation:** Handles user choices and prevents errors for invalid selections.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python Fundamentals (Lists, Dictionaries, and Strings)
- Control Flow (While loops and If/Else statements)
- Functional Programming (Defining and calling functions)
- Data Management (Managing prices and order totals)
